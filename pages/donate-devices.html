<p>Our philosophy is to target <a href="/browser-support/">the widest possible range of devices</a>, so that no browser or device is left behind. To pursue this, we constantly need new devices on which to test our framework to ensure that all users receive the best jQuery Mobile experience.</p>

<h2>Your can help: donate to our test lab</h2>
The jQuery Mobile has a test lab in Boston that currently has roughly 70 devices which gives us decent coverage of the more popular platforms and devices. However, the team of volunteers who work on the project are scattered across the globe so we simply need more devices. With your help, we can arm the team with the array of devices they need to debug and test the library effectively.

<p>Any test phone, e-reader or tablet will help us improve the library but the follow devices are urgently needed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Boot2Gecko</li>
	<li>Android 2.1-4.0</li>
	<li>iPhone/iPod Touch and iPad 3-5 (iOS 3-5)</li>
	<li>Kindle Fire</li>
	<li>Nook Color/Tablet</li>
	<li>Windows Phone 7 </li>
	<li>Windows 8 tablets</li>
	<li>Blackberry (4-7)</li>
	<li>Blackberry Playbook</li>
	<li>Nokia S^60</li>
	<li>Samsung Bada</li>
	<li>Meego</li>
	<li>Interactive TV devices</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to donate</h2>
