  - All buttons, regardless of markup, are now mini by default in toolbars. This was an implicit behavior in 1.0, but now we automatically make buttons the mini size unless explicitly set to full size when in toolbars to make this work as expected.

* Moves fixed positioning blacklist to jquery.mobile.support.js  ([34c091e](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/34c091ee6b87f43de37696d36826d145b3dd3004))

  - Fix for the jQuery Mobile download manager.

  - Path fix for the jQuery Mobile download manager.

  - Learn more about the [New jQuery Mobile Logo](http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/09/19/new-jquery-mobile-logo/)

  - Grids with more than two columns and multiple rows now get the correct CSS. Thanks [diamondq!](https://github.com/diamondq)

### Listview

* Add extra listview autodivider check ([#4901](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4901), [a77c00a](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a77c00a16fe73cdd76b61f7b106e36dc667fbf9d))
  - If a listview was nested inside a normal list then the listviewcreate event for autodividers would also fire for the parent list causing an error as this list did not contain listview data. An extra check was added to ensure the parent list is actually a listview. Thanks [marcins!](https://github.com/marcins)

* Added a 'listviewbeforefilter' event ([#4721](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4721), [9ea70df](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/9ea70dfd99fadb8494429c76bb358305dfff2583))

* Always filter the full list of items ([#4133](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4133), [35775c5](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/35775c563a3882a33f8c4e23e25f531b13fd923f))
  - Custom filter methods for listviews now always filter all list items.

* Improved border styling of listview inside collapsible content  ([3745f40](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/3745f408810f6977225c41c3bc03fec07efd6847))
  - Improved CSS for listviews and listview filter items inside collapsible content.

* Increase the level of specificity of the margin 0 rule for listview buttons to avoid margins when used in grid ([#4945](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4945), [229d8f0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/229d8f07f62543b3d7c5a16603f737d1b75a730f))

* Merge branch 'townxelliot-autodividers'  ([3f4343d](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/3f4343d7b43a76a92aa48c8739a453acb810e0b8))
  - New Listview option Autodividers. Thanks [townxelliot!](https://github.com/townxelliot)

  - Adding theming support and new styling for read only lists.

### Navbar

* Added clearfix for navbar ([#5008](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5008), [#5032](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5032), [446fed7](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/446fed733d1587d69e09e19ff0e8de44e2bdee7c))
  - CSS improvement to avoid styling issues when Navbars placed in listviews.

* Capture and retrigger clicks on the parent list item element in navbars ([#4663](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4663),  [b668b60](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b668b6006967354111f62caf96db37d63052bb52))
  - Fix for an issue on chrome/android where buttons in navbars are functionless after scroll.

* Move active state regain code out of _create() and into its own prototype-level function and use ._on() to invoke it during "pagebeforeshow" ([c0a016e](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c0a016eb6768e5df802715f8f50b3c9b47749ec9))

* Persistent navbar broken on scroll, Chrome for Android.  ([#4663](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4663), [7f312da](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7f312da8d62bdf6bb02a3d3b0764ba0be2d9c8e5))
  - Persistent navbars now work as expected. Thanks [mmavko!](https://github.com/mmavko)

* Set margin to 0 to avoid the top/bottom margin of .ui-mini being applied ([2354079](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/23540790676a4cd6e53c1157903744fc8c35cf70))

### Navigation

* Abstract backward movement in history ([#4950](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4950), [bd94e54](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/bd94e54e17d24d77bb488392ba750db4df52f6c6))
  - "window.history.back" doesn't work in phonegap applications after a page refresh, though it does work under hashchange/replacestate. The solution is to use their "navigator.app.backHistory" method along with a configuration option. The reasoning for the option is to prevent any corner cases popping up with existing phonegap applications. Forward history movement for the same usecase is _not_ addressed but remains an even lower priority.

* Avoid string concat where possible  ([d0bb999](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/d0bb999f7f840824304c0a9bd65e2051784ef2b2))
  - Code refining.

* Handle the case where the initial URL contains a non-path hash that points to a non-existing page ([207f854](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/207f854733ebdd684e2f7fea44201621cd91bc08))

* Handle URLs with parentheses properly ([#4849](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4849), [cb15dc3](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/cb15dc3b13622e5776e5e5914213bc3d974180ce))
  - The regular expression used to parse the jqmData psuedo selector restricts the use of parentheses which are valid in urls. This breaks data-ns-url selection. The fix is to avoid the pseudo selector.

* Make sure the username and password in the url are encoded ([#4787](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4787), [75ba273](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/75ba273483074d56b4b930414ea5660f4a227989))

* Overwrite stale dialog urlHistory entry instead of reusing it as-is ([#8243](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4806), [38ae834](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/38ae834662e351b79d23ba065c02720ef0e84991))
  - Fix for chaining popup opens a dialog, dialog opens a popup.

* Replace location.href references with a centralized method so we can address a XSS/cross-site-scripting issue ([#4787](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4787), [4348eac](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/4348eac153d6cc7da29797a30e6d44549e09f2eb))

* Strip authority to avoid exploits in parse regex ([#4787](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4787), [352f196](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/352f1964b685614d27a3e4ef669093778368f915))
  - As explained by @mala in Issue ([#4787](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4787)), most browsers simply strip the authority from `location.href` anyway. We can simply mimick this more secure behavior for the browsers that don't thereby avoiding the decoding XSS.

* When showing a dialog, do not append dialogHashKey if the URL already contains it ([#2656](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2656), [7966179](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7966179faac31c5f76c045eba3c9978ee88ef7ef))

### Page

* Header buttons: Added "button" to the selector ([#4638](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4638), [7cf44d4](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7cf44d443cb9b11e321b644b6715cce5ad0157d9))
  - Manual added header buttons now placed in the same line as the title.

### Phonegap

* Added a note to the docs about using underscores within foldernames in PhoneGap for Android  ([#4991](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4991), [56ed53b](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/56ed53b545d34b6db6781ee32d8b53e1e66d1215))

### Popup

* Add afteropen trigger to setTimeout with android fix  ([0b87a42](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/0b87a42671110e711725553ef0ad0fce972c3223))
  - The select menu's (now that they depend on popups) require that the first item is focused after they are open. The focus of the popup itself was deferred until after the trigger of afteropen which the select menu uses to focus its first item. As a result the focus was stolen from the select menu by the popup to the popup container.

* Add hashListeningEnabled to the intersection that establishes whether we will use history or not ([8cdc715](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/8cdc71591b42207289c1888ff0614524f0d590c3))

* Adding header/content/footer border support for popups ([#5000](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5000), [e87386d](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/e87386d5383be65675e2abdfe9856db21879f988)))
  - Adds corner support for header/content/footer container inside popups having <code>data-corners</code> attribute set to <code>true</code>

* Bind vclick handler to the document on Android  ([5572b5e](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/5572b5e10e992a95302d618694fe8bf8b4a67300))
  - To implement click-on-screen-to-dismiss-popup one must bind the "vclick" handler to the document rather than the screen, in order to prevent unpleasantness on Android 4.0. WP7 nevertheless requires the code to remain as is, because handling the screen vclick after it has bubbled to the document causes text and inputs underneath the screen to handle and then swallow the event.

* Disable popup history managment in old IE by default ([#4784](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4784), [46a65c6](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/46a65c6bd28bbaac59b3c49a7097f66296d72cc0))
  - Cause of a Windows Phone 7 (WP7) scroll position caching issue, the new popup history option is disbaled by default for old IE browsers.

  - Refactoring the popup close process to stop bubbling up to the document.

* Do not fiddle with the focus when rapid-opening/closing during reposition Input text. ([#4797](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4797), [5680ba6](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/5680ba620c719de7ea4c2c1ec97928f58442e8a9))
  - Fix for a native keyboard issue preventing data-input in forms in popups when popup-reposition occurs.

* Do not forget about the no-history-manipulation case when calling _open()  ([a1356c1](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a1356c10df988a7523ff3cb0e116b920d43ca593))
  - Popups open method improvement when no-history feature is used.

* Do not use history when there is no AJAX ([#5006](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5006), [4ed1fc7](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/4ed1fc759d2a2a024ec918711d8280ac55b0e921))
  - Fix for non working popups on BlackBerry 5.

* Eliminate the need for a popup IE6/7-specific workaround class, as well as additional scripting  ([82e6fe7](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/82e6fe7393538391d34d680ad979116f6298ffd5))
  - Popup background fix for IE6/7.

* Enable close button when history is disabled  ([d2361b5](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/d2361b5424f3fdbd446182267914de55e2432abe))
  - Make the popup close button work even if the new popup history option is disabled.

* Exclude internal attributes from dom element ([#4967](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4967), [e979160](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/e979160f89c7513541a99df5c530c5c3075d783a))
  - Fixed markup issue when popup is opened.

* First pass at disabling history with an option in popup  ([5af122f](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/5af122fa8532ee34177af7813ddaba6824ece795))
  - Added a popup option for disabling URL history management. This new option sets whether to alter the URL when a popup is open to support the browsers back button. URL history management is enabled by default.

* First pass at popup simplification  ([7a14e15](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7a14e1588977d835c72b5a62217d413cbba315be))
  - Refactoring popup code for simplification.

* Fixed the order of the tolerance parameters ([#4856](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4856), [2464e88](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/2464e88fce04e532f92687fc5cb85ed6994077c1))
  - The values for the popup tolerance option to set the distance between the popup and the window, now were interpreted as the documention says: top, right, bottom, left.

* Focus parent link on close when opened by a parent link  ([72413a0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/72413a0833c499a8ce392638c7a4e81ffc827ef6))
  - Popup calling links now get focus back when popup closed.

* Hide fixed toolbars on Android ICS native browser when popups are opened ([#4816](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4816), [#4874](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4874), [#4844](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4844), [17eb661](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/17eb6619a7e35a3fc229c8e206e51cc35dcaa078))
  - When fixed toolbars were used on a page, the use of any position:fixed elements cause havoc with rendering of stacked elements in Android. In these situations, the popup would visually appear *under* the overlay but was still clickable so this was a display bug. This issues were addressed by adding conditional logic that will toggle the toolbars from position:fixed to position:absolute when the popup is opened and closed. The drawback to this fix is fixed toolbars appear to hide when a popup is open, but this workaround is only applied to Android 4.0 and will only been seen if there are fixed toolbars and popups with an overlay theme.

* Make sure the popup is closed on destroy (including cleanup)  ([5181ea5](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/5181ea579ae3580d4513a2e5c25b3bac7003f60b))
  - Popup code refactoring

* On WP7, you get "" for an empty background, not undefined, like in IE8  ([5463fc8](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/5463fc84dcadb92137bb11b86efcff20d88cb102))
  - Fix for a WP7 popup issue.

  - The CSS-based fade in/out transition on the themed overlay causes similar visual stacking bugs as fixed toolbars in Chrome. This was addressed by removing the fade behavior on the overlay. Testing revealed that not animating the opacity of the overlay made the popup display significantly faster so this change is now applied across the board. The overlay now pops into place without a transition.

* Remove link focus, unwind stack before applying focus and tabindex  ([8416315](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/84163152be7e2344976cc20f4b896cf87315b1f7))

* Use $.inArray, because IE does not seem to have .indexOf() on arrays ([b0e6839](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b0e6839da5aeee63faf136e72b71bc834e0c8cad))

* Use just the hash as a selector in IE7/WP 7.0 ([#4917](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4917),  [cfdc782](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/cfdc782b3d6e3600f60392adbf87f8f3c4ddefa2))
  - Fixed an IE7/Windows Phone 7.0 popup open issue caused by the handling of hashes and absolute hrefs in that browsers.

* Use new ._on() binding method to attach handlers such that they are removed upon _destroy() ([c21100a](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c21100aa9e232fd923e85f976a0f00225797c098))

* Event timing difference in iOS 6 was causing zoom to be disabled and immediately re-enabled prior to the zoom taking place ([#5041](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5041), [20b3e9d](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/20b3e9dc03138fb36acdea0f38bf65b99efe27ec))

  - Browsers like Chrome provide an up and down arrow for range/number inputs but they don't fire the change event until the control is blurred. We now bind to the mouseup event and check if the value has been altered. If it has, we refresh now the slider position to reflect the value change.

* Correct slider to use _on, and guard the unbinding test ([f64ae53](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/f64ae536a68e85c754a9af91ee0698af122e7807))
